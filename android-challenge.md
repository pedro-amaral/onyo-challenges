### **API** ###

Company list: [http://api.staging.onyo.com/v1/mobile/brand/1/company](http://api.staging.onyo.com/v1/mobile/brand/1/company)

### **Must have** ###

* Customized ActionBar
* Company list
* Category list
* Asynchronous and on demand image loading
* Dependency management system (Gradle, Maven)
* Minimum SDK version must be **15**

### **Optional, but recommended** ###

* Tabs (customized or not)
* API Communication Framework (Retrofit, Volley, OkHttp, ...)
* ORM Framework (SugarORM, GreenDAO, ActiveAndroid, SquiDB, ...)
* Image loading and cache Framework (Glide, Picasso, ...)
* Annotation/Dependency Injection Framework (AndroidAnnotations, Dagger, RoboGuice, ...)
* Unit Testing (JUnit, Robolectric, ...)
* Functional tests (Robotium Solo, UIAutomator, Espresso, ...)

*The frameworks are just a suggestion. You can use any other frameworks and surprise us!*

### **ATENTION** ###
1. You don`t need to worry about the category images height. You can assume that all the images have the same height.
2. You should not try to push changes directly to this repository.

### **Submission Process** ###
The candidate must implement the app and send a Pull Request to this repository with the solution.

The Pull request process works on either of this ways:

1. The candidate forks the repository (should not clone it directly)
2. Works on the code using the forked repository.
3. Commit and push changes to the forked repository.
4. Using the GitHub interface, send the pull request.
5. Notify us by e-mail.

Or if you want some privacy with your code:

1. Create a BitBucket private repository.
2. Commit and push changes to it.
3. Add the user onyo-mobile-team as a collaborator (read-only access is enough).
4. Notify us by e-mail.
